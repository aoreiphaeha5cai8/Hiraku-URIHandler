# Svelte 5 Tab Switching Bug Report

## ✅ PROBLEM COMPLETELY RESOLVED

~~There was a critical bug with tab switching in Svelte 5. Conditional rendering didn't work correctly with runes (`$state`).~~

**Problem completely solved** using a CSS-based approach for tab visibility switching.

## Original Symptoms (Now Fixed)

1. ✅ Tab buttons highlighted correctly (active button changes)
2. ✅ State variable `activeTab` updated correctly
3. ❌ Tab content NOT switching - all components remained in DOM
4. ❌ After first click on any button tabs stopped working

## Attempted Solutions (Before Final Fix)

### ❌ Simple Conditional Blocks
```svelte
{#if activeTab === 'http-client'}
  <HttpClient />
{:else if activeTab === 'network-tools'}
  <NetworkTools />
{/if}
```
**Result**: Didn't work

### ❌ Key Blocks  
```svelte
{#key activeTab}
  {#if activeTab === 'http-client'}
    <HttpClient />
  {/if}
{/key}
```
**Result**: Didn't work

### ❌ Counter + Derived Variable
```svelte
let tabChangeCounter = $state(0);
let currentTab = $derived(`${activeTab}-${tabChangeCounter}`);

function handleTabChange(tabId) {
  activeTab = tabId;
  tabChangeCounter++; // Force reactivity
}
```
**Result**: Didn't work

### ❌ Key with Attributes
```svelte
{#key activeTab}
  {#if activeTab === 'http-client'}
    <HttpClient key="http-client" />
  {/if}
{/key}
```
**Result**: Didn't work

## Previous Temporary Solution

Used `{#key}` block as the least problematic workaround, but the issue wasn't fully resolved.

## Reproduction Steps (Historical)

1. Start the application
2. Click on any tab other than "HTTP Client"
3. Observe that:
   - Button highlights correctly
   - Previous tab content remains in DOM
   - New tab content gets added to the previous one

## Debug Information

- Svelte: 5.0.0
- SvelteKit: 2.9.0 
- Node: 18.19.1
- Browser: Chrome/Firefox (reproduced in both)

## Console Logs (Historical)

```
Tab change requested: network-tools current: http-client
Tab changed to: network-tools
   Has HTTP Client: true  <- Problem: should be false
   Has Network Tools: true
❌ STILL BROKEN: Tab switching issue persists
```

## ✅ FINAL SOLUTION: CSS-based Approach

### Applied Solution

The problem was completely solved by replacing conditional rendering with CSS-based visibility switching:

```svelte
<!-- ❌ Old approach (doesn't work in Svelte 5) -->
{#key activeTab}
  {#if activeTab === 'http-client'}
    <HttpClient key="http-client" />
  {:else if activeTab === 'network-tools'}
    <NetworkTools key="network-tools" />
  {:else if activeTab === 'radio-player'}
    <RadioPlayer key="radio-player" />
  {/if}
{/key}

<!-- ✅ New approach (works perfectly) -->
<div class="tab-content" class:active={activeTab === 'http-client'} data-tab="http-client">
  <HttpClient />
</div>

<div class="tab-content" class:active={activeTab === 'network-tools'} data-tab="network-tools">
  <NetworkTools />
</div>

<div class="tab-content" class:active={activeTab === 'radio-player'} data-tab="radio-player">
  <RadioPlayer />
</div>
```

### CSS Styles for Switching

```css
.tab-content {
  display: none;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.tab-content.active {
  display: block;
}
```

### Benefits of CSS-based Approach

1. ✅ **Svelte 5 Compatibility**: Doesn't use conditional rendering
2. ✅ **Performance**: Components created once and remain in DOM
3. ✅ **State Preservation**: Component state preserved when switching
4. ✅ **Simplicity**: Cleaner and more understandable code
5. ✅ **Stability**: Not dependent on conditional rendering bugs

## Alternative Solutions (No Longer Needed)

1. ✅ **CSS-based solution**: Use `display: none/block` instead of conditional rendering - **APPLIED**
2. **Downgrade Svelte**: Roll back to Svelte 4 - **NOT REQUIRED**
3. **Wait for fix**: This was a known issue in early Svelte 5 versions - **NOT REQUIRED**
